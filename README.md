## ATM-Simulation-Java-OOP
<h1>📌 Project Overview</h1>

This Java project demonstrates the **basic concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — specifically, how to create and use **classes and objects**.

The example simulates a simple **ATM interface** using a class named `ATM`, with functionalities like:

- 🔐 **PIN verification**
- 💰 **Balance checking**
- 💵 **Depositing money**
- 💳 **Withdrawing money**

It is a **console-based application** (runs in the terminal panel of VS Code) aimed at helping beginners understand how methods and variables are organized within a class, and how to access them through an object.
